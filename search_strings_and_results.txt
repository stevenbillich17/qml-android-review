IEEE 33 entries


From all IEE searches there were:
38 unique journal articles / conference papers

After filtering based on abstract title etc -> 

From those I started verifying maybe papers -> obtained just a few from them.
After that we read the papers that were marked “include” => 12 papers left

After reading those papers -> see observations and table



Science Direct: 
quantum machine learning ("android" OR "mobile" or "APK") -> 21 results (2022-2026)
quantum AND ("machine learning" OR "convolution" or "convolutional") AND ("android" OR "mobile" or "APK") -> 11 results (2022-2026)
("quantum" OR "QML)  AND ("neural network" OR "neural network" or "neural networks") AND ("android" OR "mobile" or "APK") -> 19 results (2022-2026)
"quantum" and "android" and ("malware" or "threat" or "detection" or "threats") / not used

=> Merge them and we obtained 23 unique results


Science direct searches were made on 01.02.2026 at 12:14PM. (bucharest time)
After reading the abstract we included for full screening a number of 9 articles remain for full screening
Problem accessing one of them -> 8 remained
